Challenges
While developing this project, I encountered several challenges and how I overcame them:

Database Integration: Setting up the MySQL database and configuring the connection posed initial challenges. I overcame this by thoroughly studying MySQL documentation and consulting online resources.

Security: Ensuring that the application is secure from SQL injection and other vulnerabilities required implementing data validation and prepared statements in MySQL queries.

Frontend Design: Designing an appealing and user-friendly interface was a challenge. I researched modern design principles and used CSS to create a visually pleasing user experience.

Express Routing: Defining routes and handling HTTP requests effectively was challenging. I studied Express.js documentation and used middleware to structure the routes.
